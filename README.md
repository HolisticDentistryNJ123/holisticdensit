Holistic Dentistry NJ - Emergency Safe Mercury Amalgam Removal Treatment - Dr. Philip Memoli

When the element mercury accumulates to a high concentration in the body, it can lead to a variety of acute and chronic medical problems, including organ damage and compromise of major bodily systems.

Dentists who focus on <a href="http://holisticdentistrynj.com/safe-amalgam-mercury-removal%2F/AA017875">safe amalgam removal </a>must receive specialized training in the practice; they also follow government guidelines for containment of mercury vapor during the procedure and disposal of mercury-containing materials afterward.
The symptoms of mercury toxicity are manifold; poisoning from the element can affect every part of the body, including the neurological, central nervous, gastrointestinal, immune, neuromuscular, and cardiovascular systems, as well as major organs, such as the brain, liver, and kidneys.

Multiple medical studies report that the effects of mercury toxicity can be mitigated and often reversed when proper procedures are implemented to remove the sources of mercury poisoning in the body. The most common source of mercury entering the body is from mercury fillings, suggesting that a safe, comprehensive protocol of mercury amalgam removal and replacement can lead to a marked improvement in health.

A patient coming to The Center for Systemic Dentistry will be the recipient of a state-of-the-art protocol for safe removal of mercury amalgam. A comprehensive initial dental exam and systemic assessment determine the extent of mercury damage. This exam and an evaluation of the patient’s overall health help the doctor to determine if the patient is at risk of systemic reaction in the immune, detoxification, or elimination systems.

A safe, effective program for removal of mercury amalgam is the first step toward reversing the effects of mercury toxicity in your body. The Center for Systemic Dentistry in Berkeley Heights, New Jersey, is committed to being the state’s leading dental practice that focuses on holistic, healing-focused dentistry.
